## Extras

The `fish-venv` plugin offers additional, optional functionalities aimed at further simplifying and enhancing your development workflow. These "extras" are designed to be modular and can be enabled or disabled as per your preferences.

### Current Extras:

- **auto-venv:** Automatically activates the relevant Python virtual environment when you enter a directory. This extra eliminates the need to manually activate virtual environments as you navigate between your projects.

    **Enable auto-venv:**

    ```shell
    venv enable auto-venv
    ```

    **Disable auto-venv:**

    ```shell
    venv disable auto-venv
    ```

    The inspiration for "auto-venv" extra came from the [auto-venv](https://github.com/nakulj/auto-venv) Fish Shell plugin.
